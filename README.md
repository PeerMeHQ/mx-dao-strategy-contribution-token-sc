# Contribute Token Strategy for DAOs

Enables users to contribute funds to registered apps, which can be DAOs, and receive a proportional amount of receipt tokens. These tokens can be used in DAO systems like PeerMe for voting and fair ownership distribution.

## Key Features

1. **Seamless Fund Contributions**

   - Users send funds to the contract.
   - The contract forwards the funds to the defined apps/DAO.

2. **Receipt Token Issuance**

   - The contract mints receipt tokens proportional to the total contributions.
   - Transfers these tokens to the user.

3. **DAO Integration**
   - Receipt tokens can be used on [PeerMe](https://peerme.io) for voting and ownership distribution.

This strategy is optimized to enable collective ownership and decision-making, with voting power based on one's contributions.
